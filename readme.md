# Botbase

Botbase is a bot in a can, an instant, well architected bot made in go, tailored to you.

To start you just need to install cookiecutter `pip install cookiecutter`

Then you go to your gopath github folder, for example mine would be `go/src/github.com/JonSnowbd`. And then
you just run `cookiecutter https://github.com/JonSnowbd/botbase` and from that your bot will be placed in your
folder ready to be ran or compiled.

Also its `go get` compatible!
